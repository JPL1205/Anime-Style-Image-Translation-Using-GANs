# Anime-Style-Image-Translation-Using-GANs

We implemented a GAN architecture that leverages Residual Blocks within the generator to enhance the translation. The dataset we choose comprises real-world images from COCO dataset and corresponding anime-style from https://www.kaggle.com/alamson/safebooru, with the latter undergoing a smoothing process for improved style consistency. The results demonstrate the modelâ€™s ability to translate the style of input images, presenting a novel application of GANs in the domain of animate image transformation.
